PRIOR HISTORY

There is no double accounting of emission reductions in the project activity due to the following reasons:
• The project activity was applied (Consideration) in CDM on 18 June 14. However said project
was not registered and no  CER’s have been issued for the same project. The project activity is
now seeking CoUs under the UCR CoU Standard/Program for the period 31/10/2015 to
31/12/2022 and hence there is no double counting issue of carbon credits for the said vintage
period. Additionally, the same has been stated in the undertaking provided in the Double
Counting Avoidance Assurance Document (DAA) by the PP.
